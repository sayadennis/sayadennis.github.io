I am a PhD student in biomedical informatics in [Dr. Yuan Luo's lab](https://labs.feinberg.northwestern.edu/luolab/) under [Feinberg School of Medicine](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University in Chicago, IL. I am interested in the applications of machine learning in medicine, and my thesis focuses specifically on 1) risk stratification of breast cancer using patient genomic data, and 2) finding clues for treatment optimzation for breast cancer using electronic health records (EHR) data. I am also passionate about topics of reproducibility, generalizability and fairness of ML in the biomedical and clinical space. 

Outside of research, I work part-time as a Research Computing Consultant for the university's high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure to assist with the needs of a diverse community of researchers. I also enjoy nurturing social communities, and serve in several student organizations including Northwestern University's official Japanese Graduate Student Association (JGSA) and the [Japanese Graduate Student Across the United States](https://gakuiryugaku.net/). 

In my free time, I love to cook, eat, travel, and read. Check out my [book blog](https://sayadennis.github.io/blog/) for my recent picks!
