I am a PhD student in biomedical informatics in [Dr. Yuan Luo's lab](https://labs.feinberg.northwestern.edu/luolab/) under [Feinberg School of Medicine](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University in Chicago, IL. My interests are in bioinformatics and applications of ML/DL. I am particularly excited in the engineering aspect of these domains, and am passionate about topics like deployment, productionization, scaling, distributed computing/processing, and CI/CD. I am also passionate about topics of reproducibility, generalizability and fairness of ML. Feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn if you want to chat! 

I am an impact-driven, curious, and collaborative worker. I find it rewarding when the quality of my work has a direct impact on my team/organizationâ€™s success. I find joy in continuous growth, and thrive in an environment where I can tackle new challenges. I love working in a team of people with diverse backgrounds and strengths. Through my experiences with managing student organizational leadership teams, I have developed a collaborative leadership style to play to each memberâ€™s strengths.

Contrary to my professional interests, I am a big history nerd ðŸ¤“ My favorite book genre is historical fiction, my favorite cuisine is home-cooked Japanese (I'm born and raised there!), and I've been venturing out to drawing & painting recently.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
