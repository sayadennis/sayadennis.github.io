## A long time coming read 

This book had been sitting on my reading list for about as long as the covid pandemic! It was recommended to me by a friend (thank you Misaki-chan!) but some It's actually quite common for me to wait for a comically long time before I actually read a book. I like 

An impact that a book can have on you is truly immense. It's almost deceivingly so, considering it's unassuming physical presence: just a bundle of paper with some ink. The world can look so different between before and after reading a book. Your life, really, altered in that point in time.  

Ted Chiang's Exhalation was one of those books that spoke to me at an extremely deep and emotional level. What I mean by this is that it brought to question some of the fundamental things I assume about the world. The questions it poses are not ones that are cheap and low-hanging, but deeply thought-out and profound. The analogies that some of the stories give are not just reinforcing of our current inklings about the world, but actually eye-opening, bringing to light entirely new ways to see the word around us. (The truth of feelings and truth of fact especially. And maybe also the digient story. Exhalation blew me away too but in a different way)  

I'm so glad I decided to read this book!! I hope to read it again someday in the future.
