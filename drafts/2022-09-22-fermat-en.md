## The history of science is so powerful 

the drama that surrounds this theory!! burning of libraries, dark ages of mathematics, the introverted 'prince of amateurs' taunting colleagues, the suicidal aristocrat, the popularization of puzzles, the un-provability problem... The sheer scope of the fabric of drama that surrounds this equation is so immense that it's difficult to see with a birds-eye view. 

## Thankful for my elementary education 

Seeing personal stories of all the famous scholars (pythagoras, pascal, euler, turing...) is the coolest thing ever. This would not be so rewarding unless I learned boring equations and plain-looking units named after these people.
