After a tragic plane crash that took the lives of dozens, I see a news headline that the president blamed diversity policies for the crash. It reads that when asked for evidence, he responded, "I have common sense." I cringe, my chest tightening ––who would fall for such ridiculous rhetoric? Minutes later, I see a social media post attributing the accident to the president himself, who had removed a large part of air traffic control work force. This one draws me in for a few seconds longer.

For many people living in the United States, such "fight or flight" responses to political topics feel familiar. The tensing of the body when you hear your relative bring up politics at a family party, and the doomscrolling spiral you somehow can't escape. 

*High Conflict*, by investigative journalist Amanda Ripley, describes why well-meaning people oftentimes find themselves locked into never-ending battles where it feels as though the opposing side has simply lost their minds.

Ripley makes an important distinction: healthy conflict is uncomfortable but productive, leading to growth. High conflict, however, is all-consuming, with poor outcomes for everyone involved. Through stories of Chicago street gangs, small-town politics, Colombian guerrilla fighters, and the polarization of American discourse, she reveals how conflict can pull us in like inescapable gravity. 

We aren't crazy for falling into these patterns. Ripley outlines key reasons: our instinct to hold onto *group identities*—racial, political, even culinary—which fosters community but can fuel division in unfortunate circumstances; *the illusion of communication*, where we believe we've made ourselves clear when we haven't; and the unsettling reality that conflict, in times of uncertainty, can provide a sense of purpose. Then there are the *conflict entrepreneurs*—those who profit from division and work to deepen it. 

One idea that resonated with me was *psychological safety*. When we feel threatened, curiosity goes out the window. This leaves little room to ask for clarification or second-guess our assumptions, because we must defend ourselves before we are attacked.

I remember a debate with my partner early in our relationship. We rarely fight, but one night, discussing affirmative action, I slipped into defensiveness. I vividly recall this night, as I myself was perplexed by the inexplainable trap of defensiveness that somehow could not get out of. Although our core values were aligned on the importance of equity, our opinions on the extent of enforcement differed. Somehow, in that moment, everything my partner said to explain his thoughts felt like attacks to my beliefs that I had to talk back against. 

The second half of *High Conflict* focuses on escape routes —how people disentangle themselves from these destructive yet inescapable cycles. Ripley shares strategies like buying time (slowing down heated exchanges) and acknowledging different aspects of identity (e.g. talking about fatherhood to acknowledge someone's parental identify beyond political affiliations). These tactics make conflict feel less like an existential battle and more like a disagreement we can live with. One of the most extraordinary stories in the book is that of a cultural exchange program between ultra liberal Manhattan Jews and ultra conservative Michigan Christians, where, through safe conversations, they find the humanity in each other. 

For many years now, my partner and I were able to create an enrivonment with psychological safety. We know that much of our most important values align, and that we respect and make an effort to listen each other when our opinions differ. Although our political beliefs largely align (and I'm sure sometimes we're our own little echo chamber), but it is also not uncommon that we surprise one another with counterpoints, challenging our assumptions in a way that feels curious and constructive.

When Joe comes home, the tragic plane crash comes up. I vent about the blame against diversity policies, and he calms me down by assuring he's just saying whatever. Then I mention the claim that the president’s policies caused the crash, unaware of my longing tone for affirmation. But Joe surprises me: "I saw that headline too, but I want to be cautious of that rhetoric. I need to know what exactly happened in the crash first to make my judgement."

The moment you are pulled out of a subconscious and unnecessary "fight or flight" mode is a sobering one, yet one that comes with an incredible sense relief. Side by side, we look up the facts, sifting through reports and discussing them. In our own little bubble, we’ve built a space where we can challenge each other without feeling attacked, stay curious, and remain open to being surprised.
