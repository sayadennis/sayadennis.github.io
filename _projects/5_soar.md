* SOAR is a comprehensive database of 304 spatial transcriptomics datasets from 11 species across 40 tissue types.
* Use SOAR to evaluate the spatial variability of genes in different tissues, assess possible cell-cell interactions, perform drug discovery, and visualize the spatial gene expression of 2,785 samples.
* Our fast and easy to use analytic and visualization framework aims to support your research needs!
